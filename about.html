 <h4>Bio</h4>
 <p><i>Hello World!</i></p>

 <p>I'm Julian Doerschlag, a multidisciplinary designer based in the vibrant city of Vancouver, BC. With a keen interest in creative problem-solving, I specialize in delving deep into design challenges to transform good ideas into great projects. My expertise spans various design disciplines, including print, packaging, web design, and branding. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse clients, helping them bring their visions to life through thoughtful and effective design solutions. Whether working on a logo or a comprehensive brand identity, I aim to craft designs that not only look great but also communicate a clear message.
<br><br>
<h4>Inspirations</h4>
 My design approach is heavily influenced by my personal hobbies and <a href="#interests">interests</a> as well as a diverse range of global design movements. I draw inspiration from a variety of sources, including vintage aesthetics, modern design trends, and the unique blend of minimalism and bold expression found in Japanese graphic design. I also find creative energy in the tech-forward, futuristic styles of the 1980s, which influence much of my work. By fusing these diverse influences, I am able to create designs that feel both timeless and innovative, with a strong emphasis on detail and clarity.
 <br><br>
 <h4>Experience</h4>
 In 2023, I graduated from the Graphic Design for Marketing Program at KPU, which provided me with a solid foundation in both design theory and practical skills. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge further by pursuing the UX/UI Certificate Program at BCIT, which I began in early 2024. This program allows me to deepen my understanding of user experience and interface design, skills that I integrate into my projects to ensure they not only look great but also provide seamless and intuitive user interactions. My ongoing education helps me stay ahead of industry trends and enables me to continue delivering high-quality design work for my clients.
